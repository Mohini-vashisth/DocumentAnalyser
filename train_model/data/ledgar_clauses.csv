In no event shall there be included in the Conveyances at Closing any Asset subject to an unsatisfied consent requirement that would be triggered by the purchase and sale of Assets contemplated by this Agreement and provides that transfer of the Asset without consent will result in (i) a termination or other material impairment of any existing rights in relation to such Asset, or (ii) the payment of liquidated damages absent the consent (such consent requirement, a “ Consent Requirement ”); provided that any consent requirement that by its terms may not be unreasonably withheld shall not be considered a Consent Requirement. In cases where the Asset subject to a Consent Requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Consent Requirement, Seller shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the applicable consent so that Seller’s right, title and interest in such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon the receipt of such consent. In cases where the Asset subject to a Consent Requirement is a Property and the third Person consent to the sale and transfer of such Property is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may elect to treat the unsatisfied Consent Requirement as a Title Defect by giving Seller notice thereof in accordance with Section 3.4(a) , except that such notice may be given on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however , the Title Defect Amount for such Property may not be used in meeting the Title Defect Deductible, and Seller may elect to cure such unsatisfied Consent Requirement under Section 3.4(c) , in which event the provisions of Section 3.4(c) shall apply, provided further that the affected Asset shall be excluded from the Assets for purposes of Closing until the Consent Requirement is waived or satisfied (unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser). In cases where an Asset is subject to a third Person consent requirement that is not a Consent Requirement, the Asset shall be included in the Assets at Closing (unless excluded pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement) and Purchaser shall be responsible after Closing for satisfying such consent requirement at its sole cost, risk and expense, to the extent the applicable consent was not obtained or waived on or prior to Closing. If an unsatisfied Consent Requirement for which a Purchase Price adjustment is made at Closing is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final determination of the Final Settlement Statement (the “ Final Settlement Date ”), Seller shall receive an additional upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in the Final Settlement Statement equal to the amount of the previous reduction in the Purchase Price on account of the Consent Requirement and the provisions of this Section 3.5 shall no longer apply except for the assignment made under the next sentence. Within five (5) Business Days of the satisfaction of any Consent Requirement that was unsatisfied at Closing, but prior to the Final Settlement Date, but was subsequently satisfied after Closing, Seller shall assign to Purchaser using substantially the same form as the Conveyance, to the extent previously unassigned, each Property subject to such Consent Requirement and, to the extent not previously included in the adjustments to the Purchase Price at Closing, the Parties shall account to one another under Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 .",safe

Neither Borrower, Master Tenant nor any of its constituent Persons are contemplating either the filing of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower’s or Master Tenant’s assets or property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such petition against it or Master Tenant, and the transactions contemplated by the Master Lease Documents or such constituent Persons.",safe
